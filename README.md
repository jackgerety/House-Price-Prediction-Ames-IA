# üè† Ames Housing Price Prediction

This project uses **data cleaning** and **linear regression** techniques in python to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa, based on a dataset from Kaggle.

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
- **Target variable**: `SalePrice` (USD)
- **Features**: 80 explanatory (categorical + numerical) variables (excludes PID and Order #)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python3
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or Virtual Environment (dependency list with versions included in dependencies.txt)

## üß™ Workflow

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical features (One-Hot Encoding, Ordinal Mapping)
- Normalize/scale numerical features

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Visualized the distribution of sale prices

- Visualized feature relationships (e.g., `GrLivArea` vs. `SalePrice`)
  ![General Living Area vs Sale Price](images/grlivar_vs_saleprice.png)
- Removed outliers if needed

### 3. **Modeling**
- I trained the **Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`

### 4. **Evaluation**
- Evaluate using:
  - **R¬≤ score**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- Plot **predicted vs. actual prices**

## üìä Results Explained
- An **R¬≤** score of 0.9 is pretty good. **R¬≤** is another term for the measure of correlation (R) between two variables squared. It's a scalable way to measure how closely the predicted and actual sale prices correlate. By scalable, I mean that a score of 0.4 is twice as good of a correlation as a score of 0.2. A score of 1.0 shows exact correlation, either negative or positive. Since there are no negative house prices, there is no negative correlation between actual and predicted. A score of 0.0 means that there is no correlation. 
- Another measure of how well the actual data points agree with the model's predictions is the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**. Essentially what this measures is the residual standard deviation of the data points from the predictions. On the scatter plot above, this calculation is visualized with the two dotted lines parallel to the ideal line which show the average amount that the y values disagree with said ideal line.
